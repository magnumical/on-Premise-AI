This project demonstrates a simple Python-based setup to send a request from one computer (Computer 1) to another (Computer 2) over a local network. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.

```
pip install flask requests
```


next step would be:
1. using docker and running multiple projects at the same time.
2. Implementing orchestration and efficient resource management for shared resources
